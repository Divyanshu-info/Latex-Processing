\subsection{Solution Approach: Designing an Investment Portfolio}

\subsubsection{Method}
To design an investment portfolio for individuals with varying annual earnings, we will follow a comprehensive approach that considers their financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. The portfolio will be diversified to balance potential returns and risk. The investment instruments chosen will vary based on the income levels and investment objectives of the individuals.

\subsubsection{Materials}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Financial Assessment:} Understand each individual's financial goals, risk appetite, time horizon, and liquidity needs. This assessment will provide the foundation for constructing a suitable portfolio.
    
    \item \textbf{Asset Allocation:} Determine the allocation of assets within the portfolio. This involves dividing investments among different asset classes like stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments. The allocation percentages will depend on the individual's risk tolerance and investment horizon.
    
    \item \textbf{Diversification Strategy:} Select a mix of investments within each asset class to diversify risk. Diversification helps reduce the impact of poor performance in any one investment on the overall portfolio.
    
    \item \textbf{Investment Instruments:} Choose specific investment vehicles based on the income levels:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{For Lower Income Levels (10 lakhs - 30 lakhs):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Equity Mutual Funds:} To capture potential high returns over the long term.
            \item \textbf{Debt Instruments (Bonds, Fixed Deposits):} For stability and regular income.
            \item \textbf{Emergency Fund:} Hold a portion of funds in a liquid, low-risk account for unexpected expenses.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{For Moderate Income Levels (50 lakhs):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Real Estate:} Consider real estate investments for diversification and potential appreciation.
            \item \textbf{Equities:} Invest in individual stocks for potential higher returns.
            \item \textbf{Mutual Funds:} Include a mix of equity and debt mutual funds.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{For High Income Levels (1 Crore):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Private Equity or Venture Capital:} Explore alternative investments for potential higher returns.
            \item \textbf{Global Investments:} Consider diversifying into international markets through global mutual funds or Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).
            \item \textbf{Customized Solutions:} Depending on individual preferences, consider tailored investment solutions like structured products.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Logical Reasoning}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Risk-Return Trade-off:} The allocation of investments will be based on the risk-return trade-off. Individuals with higher earnings might be more open to higher-risk investments in pursuit of potentially higher returns.
    
    \item \textbf{Diversification:} By diversifying across asset classes, we reduce the impact of market fluctuations on the portfolio's value. This strategy also helps in capturing gains from different economic cycles.
    
    \item \textbf{Liquidity Needs:} Depending on income levels, liquidity needs might vary. Lower-income individuals may need more immediate liquidity, while higher-income individuals can allocate more to longer-term investments.
    
    \item \textbf{Long-Term Goals:} Individuals with higher earnings might have long-term financial goals such as retirement, education funding, or legacy planning. The investment portfolio should align with these goals.
    
    \item \textbf{Tax Efficiency:} Investment choices will also consider tax implications. Instruments like tax-efficient mutual funds or tax-free bonds might be suitable for individuals in higher income brackets.
    
    \item \textbf{Adaptability:} The portfolio should be periodically reviewed and adjusted to adapt to changing market conditions, individual goals, and risk tolerance.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Conclusion}
Remember, the design of an investment portfolio is a personalized process. It's essential to consult with a qualified financial advisor who can consider individual circumstances and provide tailored advice.
