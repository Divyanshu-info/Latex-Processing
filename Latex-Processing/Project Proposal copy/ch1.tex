\section{Funding Plan}

\subsection{Equity}

Patanjali will invest Rs. 50 crore in equity in the project. This will cover the cost of land acquisition, site preparation, and construction of the plant.

\subsection{Debt}

Patanjali will raise Rs. 75 crore in debt to finance the installation of machinery and equipment, recruitment and training of staff, and other working capital requirements.

\subsection{Source of Debt}

Patanjali may raise debt from a variety of sources, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Commercial banks:} Commercial banks are a traditional source of debt financing for businesses. Patanjali may be able to obtain a loan from a commercial bank at a competitive interest rate.
    \item \textbf{Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs):} NBFCs are another source of debt financing for businesses. NBFCs may be willing to lend to Patanjali at a higher interest rate than commercial banks, but they may be more flexible in terms of the loan terms and conditions.
    \item \textbf{Foreign investors:} Patanjali may also be able to raise debt from foreign investors. Foreign investors may be willing to lend to Patanjali at a lower interest rate than domestic lenders, but they may have more stringent terms and conditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Repayment of Debt}

Patanjali will repay the debt over a period of 5 years. The debt will be repaid in equal monthly installments. The debt repayment will be funded from the cash flow generated by the new manufacturing plant.

\subsection{Financial Projections}

The following are the projected financial statements for the new manufacturing plant:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Year} & \textbf{Revenue (in Rs. crore)} & \textbf{Operating Profit (in Rs. crore)} & \textbf{Net Profit (in Rs. crore)} \\
\hline
1 & 100 & 10 & 5 \\
2 & 120 & 12 & 6 \\
3 & 150 & 15 & 7.5 \\
4 & 180 & 18 & 9 \\
5 & 210 & 21 & 10.5 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

As you can see, the new manufacturing plant is expected to generate a significant amount of revenue and profit. The revenue and profit will be used to repay the debt and grow the business.

\subsection{Additional Considerations}

The following are some additional considerations for the funding plan:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Interest rates:} The interest rates on debt financing will impact the cost of the project. Patanjali should carefully consider the different interest rates offered by different lenders before making a decision.
    \item \textbf{Loan terms and conditions:} The loan terms and conditions, such as the repayment period and collateral requirements, will also impact the project. Patanjali should carefully consider the loan terms and conditions offered by different lenders before making a decision.
    \item \textbf{Currency risk:} If Patanjali raises debt from foreign investors, it will be exposed to currency risk. Patanjali should hedge against currency risk to protect itself from adverse fluctuations in the exchange rate.
\end{itemize}

Patanjali should carefully consider all of the relevant factors before making a decision about how to finance the project to set up an additional manufacturing plant in Surat, Gujarat.
