\subsection{Overview of Government eMarketplace GeM}


The Government e-Marketplace (GeM) is an online portal that facilitates the procurement of goods and services by various government departments, organizations, and Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) in India. It is a one-stop-shop for government buyers to find, compare, and buy products and services from a wide range of sellers across India. GeM aims to enhance transparency, efficiency, and speed in public procurement.

\subsection{Background}

The Indian government has been making efforts to modernize its procurement processes for several years. In 2012, the government launched the e-Procurement initiative, which aimed to reduce paperwork and improve transparency in public procurement. However, the e-Procurement initiative was not very successful, and the government felt that a more comprehensive solution was needed.

In 2016, the government launched GeM to replace the e-Procurement initiative. GeM was developed by the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS\&D), which is a central government organization responsible for procurement for the Indian government.

\subsection{Objectives of GeM}

The main objectives of GeM are to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enhance transparency in public procurement:} GeM is a transparent platform that allows buyers to view all bids and compare prices from different sellers. This helps to prevent corruption and ensure that the government gets the best value for its money.
    \item \textbf{Improve efficiency in public procurement:} GeM automates many of the manual tasks involved in procurement, such as bid evaluation and order processing. This helps to save time and money for both buyers and sellers.
    \item \textbf{Increase speed in public procurement:} GeM simplifies the procurement process and reduces the time it takes to procure goods and services. This helps to improve the delivery of government services to citizens.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Features of GeM}

GeM offers a wide range of features to buyers and sellers, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Online bidding:} Buyers can submit bids online for goods and services.
    \item \textbf{Reverse auction:} GeM supports reverse auction, which is a type of auction in which the price of a good or service is lowered until only one bidder remains.
    \item \textbf{Demand aggregation:} GeM allows buyers to aggregate demand for goods and services, which can help them to get better prices.
    \item \textbf{E-payment:} GeM supports electronic payment, which is a secure and convenient way to pay for goods and services.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Impact of GeM}

GeM has had a significant impact on public procurement in India. It has helped to increase transparency, efficiency, and speed in procurement. GeM has also helped to promote competition among sellers, which has led to lower prices for the government.

\subsection{Prior Challenges in Public Procurement}

Prior to the implementation of the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), the public procurement system in India faced several challenges that hindered its efficiency, transparency, and effectiveness. These challenges included:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Fragmented and Manual Procurement Process:} Public procurement was handled by various government departments and organizations, each with its own procurement procedures and practices. This fragmented approach led to a lack of standardization, duplication of effort, and inefficiencies. Moreover, the manual nature of the process was time-consuming, error-prone, and prone to manipulation.
    
    \item \textbf{Lack of Transparency and Accountability:} The traditional procurement system was often opaque, lacking transparency in bid evaluation, contract award, and supplier selection. This lack of transparency created opportunities for corruption and favoritism, undermining the integrity of the procurement process.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited Market Access and Competition:} The fragmented and manual procurement process favored large and well-connected suppliers, making it difficult for smaller businesses to participate in government procurement. This limited competition resulted in higher procurement costs and limited innovation in the supply chain.
    
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Demand Aggregation and Price Discovery:} The decentralized nature of procurement led to inefficient demand aggregation and price discovery. Buyers often procured similar goods and services from different suppliers at different prices, missing out on opportunities for cost savings through bulk purchases.
    
    \item \textbf{High Transaction Costs and Administrative Burdens:} The manual and paper-based procurement process involved significant administrative burdens and transaction costs for both buyers and suppliers. These costs included paperwork, transportation, and physical meetings, adding to the overall procurement expenditure.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Need for GeM}

The need for GeM arose from the recognition that the traditional procurement system was not adequately addressing these challenges. A centralized, transparent, and efficient e-procurement platform was needed to modernize public procurement in India and reap the benefits of a more effective and cost-efficient system. GeM was designed to address these challenges and transform the way the government procures goods and services.
