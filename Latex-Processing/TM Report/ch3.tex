Here is the graph depicting the number of patents granted to IBM each year from 2013 to 2022, based on the data you provided. The graph shows variations in the number of patents granted over this period, with a general trend of increase until around 2020, followed by a decrease in the last two years.

\subsection{Factors Contributing to Decline in IBM's Patent Grants}

The decline in the number of patents granted to IBM in subsequent years could be attributed to several factors:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Strategic Shift in Innovation Focus:} Companies often shift their strategic focus over time, which can affect their patent output. IBM has been known to realign its research and development efforts towards new and emerging fields like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cloud services. This shift might lead to a decrease in the quantity of patents but potentially an increase in their strategic importance or quality.

  \item \textbf{Changes in Patent Filing Strategies:} The approach to patenting can change over time, prioritizing quality over quantity. IBM might have decided to pursue fewer, more impactful patents rather than a larger number of broad, less significant ones.

  \item \textbf{Market and Technological Changes:} As technology and market demands evolve, IBM's research and development efforts might also adapt, potentially leading to a temporary decrease in patent output as new areas of research are developed.

  \item \textbf{Economic and Budgetary Considerations:} Economic factors, including R\&D budgets and cost considerations, can influence the number of patents a company files. Reducing expenses in certain areas can lead to fewer patent filings.

  \item \textbf{Competitive Landscape:} The rise of new competitors in key technology areas can also influence patent counts. As more companies enter fields like AI and cloud computing, IBM's relative share of patents in these areas might decrease.
\end{itemize}

It's important to note that a decrease in patent numbers doesn't necessarily reflect a decline in innovation or success. Companies like IBM often focus on the strategic value of patents, which isn't solely determined by quantity.

\section{IBM Technology Readiness Level (TRL)}
\subsubsection{Technology Readiness Level}

Technology readiness levels (TRLs) are a type of risk assessment tool used to evaluate the maturity of a technology. TRLs are typically used in the context of research and development (R\&D) to assess the likelihood of a technology being successfully commercialized.

IBM uses TRLs to assess the maturity of its own technologies, as well as the technologies of its partners and suppliers. IBM also uses TRLs to communicate the maturity of its technologies to its customers.

This report provides an overview of IBM's TRL process and the current TRL status of some of IBM's key technologies.

\subsubsection{TRL Process}

IBM's TRL process is based on a nine-level scale, with each level representing a different stage of technological maturity. The following table provides a brief overview of the nine TRLs:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{10cm}|}
\hline
TRL & Description \\
\hline
1 & Basic principles observed and reported. \\
2 & Technology concept and/or application formulated. \\
3 & Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept. \\
4 & Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment. \\
5 & System/subsystem validation in laboratory environment. \\
6 & System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. \\
7 & System prototype demonstration in an operational environment. \\
8 & Actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration. \\
9 & Actual system qualified through successful mission operations. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

IBM's TRL process is iterative, meaning that technologies can move up and down the TRL scale as new information is learned and new developments are made.
