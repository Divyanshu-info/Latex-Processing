Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) employs the BCG Matrix, a strategic management tool, to analyze and categorize its product portfolio based on market share and market growth. The matrix classifies products into four categories: Question Mark, Star, Dog, and Cash Cow.

\subsection*{Question Mark:
}Products like Close Up, Pepsodent, Domex, Rin, Taj Mahal Tea Bags, Kissan Ketchup, and Breeze fall into this category. These are characterized by a low market share in high-growth markets, representing opportunities for expansion and increased market share. HUL may need to invest and strategize carefully to turn these products into Stars or Cash Cows.

\subsection*{Star:}
Star products, including Lifebuoy, Lux, Kissan Jam, Surf Excel, Axe, Fair and Lovely, Vim, and Wheel, have a high market share in high-growth markets. These are leaders in their respective categories and contribute significantly to HUL's revenue. Continuous investment and strategic focus are essential to maintain and enhance their market position.

\subsection*{Dog:}
Dog products have a low market share in low-growth markets. Taaza, Brooke Bond Sehatmand, Bru, and Slim-Fast fall into this category. These products may not be contributing significantly to growth, and strategic decisions need to be made about their future in the portfolio.

\subsection*{Cash Cow:}
Clinic Plus, Sunsilk, Vaseline, and Red Label are Cash Cow products. They have a high market share in low-growth markets. While they may not offer substantial growth opportunities, they generate consistent revenue and profit. HUL can use the cash generated from these products to invest in Question Marks or Stars.
\\\newline
In summary, HUL's BCG Matrix analysis guides strategic decisions, directing resources appropriately across its diverse product portfolio to ensure sustained growth and market leadership. The company can allocate resources effectively, nurturing Stars, investing selectively in Question Marks, managing Cash Cows for profitability, and making strategic decisions about Dogs.
